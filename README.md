StockTracker is a stock tracking app made in angular.
It works by asking user to input the symbol of the stock you would like to track. Once submitted the stock symbol is saved in local storage and the app makes 
api calls to fetch the stock quote data. User can delete the tracked stock or see various details such as current price, high price and change. 
There will be a green up arrow or red down arrow depending on change percentage. User can also see sentiment details of the stock where api call is made to fetch 
sentiment of past 3 months.
To run the code, clone or download the repository and open with VS Code.
To get a live version of the app visit avinashpandey1229.github.io.
